            Flamingo is fast web pages for everybody. Most of the world still does not have internet, but many websites from countries like the United States are big and complicated. This makes it hard for people with slow internet to use these sites. It is even harder for those people to put their own thoughts on the internet. With txti, anyone can use any device to share their story.

            Flamingo was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/A0_FVS">Oyebode Oluwafemi</a> because he believes that high speed internet is a responsibility, not a service people buy. He got a lot of help from his friend Jonathan.
