                How to make a web page with <a href="https://twitter.com/A0_FVS">Flamingo</a>
            </b>
            <div>
                The only thing you have to give Flamingo is the "Content."
                Flamingo takes care of the rest,
                but you can take advantage of these options:
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>
                    Custom URL
                </b>
            </div>
            <div>
                This is the part that goes after "flamingo.es/" like "flamingo.es/barry".
                Currently only accepts lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and dashes (-).
                If you put anything else in there, flamingo will change it.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>
                    Custom Edit Code
                </b>
            </div>
            <div>
                Flamingo will give you a random edit code, but you can change it.
                You have to have this to make changes to the flamingo,
                and it can never EVER be retrieved if lost.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>
                    Title
                </b>
            </div>
            <div>
                Give your flamingo a relevant title so it shows up better when shared on social media,
                search results,
                and in browser windows.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>
                    Author
                </b>
            </div>
            <div>
                Let people know who made this!
                This shows up in some searches and social media posts,
                and your Twitter handle works really nicely if you post the link on Twitter.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>
                    Description
                </b>
            </div>
            <div>
                This is a short (200 character) summary of the page.
                This shows up in Twitter cards and search results.
                Flamingo will automatically use the first 200 characters of your flamingo
                as a description if you don't provide one.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>
                    Make your flamingo easy to read and understand
                </b>
            </div>
            <div>
                You can make your flamingo robust and full-featured with links,
                images, lists, headings, and more.
                Flamingo uses a popular set of rules called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown.</a>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>#Heading 1 = biggest heading</li>
<li>Heading 2 = second biggest heading</li>
<li>Heading 3 = third biggest</li>, and so on
                    
                    <li>
                        Two spaces (space bars) at the end of a line starts a new line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Return twice (leaving an empty line) starts a new paragraph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        *italics* = italics

                <div>
                    *Images must be uploaded somewhere else (we recommend <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a>
                    Because images can really slow down pages
                    and we're all about "fast web pages for everybody,
                    " images are not displayed by default.
                    The reader has the option of displaying the images in the page or
                    just viewing links to them.
                    See an example at flamingo.es/images.
